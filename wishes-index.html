        Imagine that you have met genie. Not the one from GIN&TONIC but the one,
        who is Alladin's friend. So now genie can fulfil your 3 wishes. Its not
        really clever genie becouse he stay too long in the magic lamp and he
        cought oxygen deficiency and his power is low. So you can't just make
        wishes up, you have to pick them. Remember you have only 3 wishes.
